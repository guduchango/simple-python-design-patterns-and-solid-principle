1. Introducing a ValidationError Class

Instead of returning simple text strings as error messages, we now use a class called ValidationError. This class encapsulates the field that caused the error and the associated message.

Why is this important?

Clarity: Knowing exactly which field failed validation is critical for debugging or for displaying clear messages to users.

Flexibility: The ValidationError class can be easily extended in the future to include more information (such as error codes or severity).

Example

Before:
```python
"The amount must be a positive number."
```

After:
```python
ValidationError(field="amount", message="The amount must be a positive number.")
```

2. Use of Detailed Results in Validations

Validation strategies now return instances of ValidationError (or None if there are no errors). This allows the client code (the main validator) to structure errors in a more organized and actionable way.

Advantage:
The main validator can categorize errors, display them in a more appropriate format, or even send them to a monitoring system.

3. Use of Enumerations for Card Types

The accepted card types are now defined by an enumeration (CardType). This improves code readability and reduces errors.

Example

Before:
```python
CardTypeValidation(["Visa", "MasterCard", "Amex"])
```

After:
```python
CardTypeValidation([CardType.VISA, CardType.MASTERCARD, CardType.AMEX])
```

Advantages:
Consistency: You always work with controlled and valid values, eliminating possible typographical errors.
Extensibility: If in the future you need to add a new card type, just extend the enumeration.

4. Clearer Separation of Responsibilities

The Strategy pattern is still present, but now each component has clearer responsibilities:

Strategies are responsible only for a specific validation.
The main validator is the only one that coordinates validations and collects errors.
The additional classes (ValidationError and CardType) make the system more cohesive and less dependent on text strings.

5. Improved Maintainability and Scalability.
With this improved structure:

Add New Validations: It is as simple as creating a new class that implements the ValidationStrategy interface and returns instances of ValidationError in case of failure.

System Evolution: For example, you could include error message translation, severity levels or different response formats, all without breaking existing code.
